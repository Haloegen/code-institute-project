# **Econ Budget - Agile Development**

## **Agile Overview**

For this project, I adopted an agile approach in order to better organise the workload, and prioritise work to be completed in increments. To do this, I looked at my User Stories and divided them up into 4 main sprints, which are detailed in this document.

## **Sprints**

### **First Sprint**

The first sprint I began project planning and didnt really know what I could do, and looked for inspriration online. The inspiration came from my wife as she wanted to start budgeting our income around the house, so I set about creating a product that would enable this. Online I found a guide on how to do it, and then needed to make changes to the project to enable authentication and crud functionality.

### **Second Sprint**

This sprint which took place between 2nd of feb and 8 feb,
I set about creating base and template views and added my urls, 

The user stories I focused on were SITE ADMIN, as most of the user stories in this spring were focused on base templates, and logging data to the database.

In this sprint I also created the models and finished the boiler plate code.

### **Third Sprint**

feb 8th to feb 13th

This sprint consisted of the user stories focusing on navigation and authentication. User logging in and logging out, the conditional rendering and the user data being logged to the database. This took a bit longer than I initially expected due to the default forms causing minor issues with html verification but upon talking with tutors and my mentor the bug is only with the sign up/register page and in the code it actually renders perfectly so I was told to log the error

#### **Fourth Sprint**
feb 13th - feb 28

This sprint comprised of User stories from the Project Expenses and Catagories section. 
With the base models and views from the previous sprints all rendering to the database created Crud functionality and form validation. This sprint is longer than the others due to styling and validation of information, which took far longer than I expected when undertaking this project. A good challenge.
